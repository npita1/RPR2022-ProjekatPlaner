# Student Planner Application

This project was created in the Java programming language by a student for other students.

It is intended for students and learners who are finding it difficult to keep up with their academic duties and who would like to have a clearer view of their assignments and subjects. The subject, task, and TO-DO lists are presented to users in a clear and intuitive way. 
As tasks are completed, this planner software also gives users the opportunity to collect tokens to use them to play the in-app game when they take a break. 

This software is for you if you're sick of creating plans on paper, which is an outdated and unreliable method.

The help section of the planner app has instructions on how to use it.
